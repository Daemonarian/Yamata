# Yamata
A fan-made Outward DLC.

## Build/Run Instructions

1. Install Unity 2020.3.26f1.
2. Launch Unity and open the main folder here as a project.
3. When a Unity prompts for "API Update Required", select "No Thanks".
4. Once Unity has launched, open the "ThunderKit Settings" panel at Tools > ThunderKit > Settings.
5. Set "Game Path" and "Game Executable" in "ThunderKit Settings" to the path of your locally installed "Outward Definitive Edition.exe" file. Ensure you have selected the "Definitive Edition" executable and not the base game executable.
6. For the Unity quick build options, select "Rebuild and Launch" and "Yamata".
7. Click "Execute", and the plugin should be built and your locally installed copy of "Outward Definitive Edition" should run with the plugin installed. If you have the game installed through Steam, you may be prompted to allow the game to launch with non-standard start options; allow this.
8. A log file can be found at "Yamata/ThunderKit/BepInExPack/BepInEx/LogOutput.txt".
